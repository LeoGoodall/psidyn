# PSIDyn Documentation

Welcome to the PSIDyn documentation. PSIDyn (Python Semantic Information Dynamics) is a package for computing information-theoretic measures over natural language using Large Language Models.

## Contents

## What is PSIDyn?

PSIDyn uses LLMs as semantic probability estimators to compute information-theoretic measures between text sequences. This enables:

1. **Transfer Entropy**: Measuring directed information flow between speakers in a conversation
2. **Partial Information Decomposition**: Understanding how multiple sources combine to inform a target
